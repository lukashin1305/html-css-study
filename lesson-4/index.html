            <h2 class="content-title">Philosophy</h2>
            <p>
                Philosophy (from the Greek: love of wisdom) is the systematized study of general and fundamental questions, such as those concerning existence, reason, knowledge, values, mind, and
                language.[1][2] Philosophical methods include questioning, critical discussion, rational argument, and systematic presentation.
            </p>
            <p>
                Historically, philosophy encompassed all bodies of knowledge and a practitioner was known as a philosopher.[4] Natural philosophy, the origins of which trace back to Ancient Greece,
                encompasses astronomy, medicine, and physics.[5][6] In the transition to the modern era, various areas of investigation that were traditionally part of philosophy became separate
                academic disciplines such as psychology, sociology, linguistics, and economics.
            </p>
            <p>
                Today, major subfields of academic philosophy include metaphysics, which is concerned with the fundamental nature of existence and reality; epistemology, which studies the nature of
                knowledge and belief; ethics, which is concerned with moral value; and logic, which studies the rules of inference that allow one to derive conclusions from true premises. The history
                of philosophy is itself a philosophical undertaking. Other notable subfields include philosophy of religion, philosophy of science, political philosophy, aesthetics, philosophy of
                language, and philosophy of mind.
            </p>
            <h3 id="etymology">Etymology</h3>
            <p>
                The word "philosophy" comes from the ancient Greek words φίλος (philos: "love") and σοφία (sophia: "wisdom").[7][8][9] Etymologically, it means "the love of wisdom". Some sources claim
                the term was coined by Presocratic philosopher Pythagoras, but this is not certain.
            </p>
            <p>
                The word entered the English language primarily from Old French and Anglo-Norman starting around 1175 CE. The French term philosophie is itself a borrowing from the Latin term
                philosophia. The term philosophy acquired, and to some extent still retains, the meanings of "advanced study of the speculative subjects (logic, ethics, physics, and metaphysics)",
                "deep wisdom consisting of love of truth and virtuous living", "profound learning as transmitted by the ancient writers", and "the study of the fundamental nature of knowledge,
                reality, and existence, and the basic limits of human understanding".
            </p>
            <p>
                Before the modern age, the term philosophy was used in a very wide sense. It included most forms of rational inquiry, like the individual sciences, as its subdisciplines.[7][13][14]
                For instance, natural philosophy was considered a major branch of philosophy.[15][16] It encompassed a wide range of fields, including disciplines like physics, chemistry, and
                biology.[7][17] An example of this usage is the 1687 book Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica by Isaac Newton. This book referred to natural philosophy in its title, but it is
                today considered a book of physics.
            </p>
            <h3 class="conceptions-title">Conceptions of philosophy</h3>
            <h4>General conception</h4>
            <p>
                The practice of philosophy is characterized by various general features: it is a form of rational inquiry, it aims to be systematic, and it tends to critically reflect on its own
                methods and presuppositions.[20][21][18] It requires thinking "as hard and as clearly...about some of the most interesting and enduring problems that human minds have ever
                encountered"; many of these we cannot avoid, but are unable to answer once and for all.
            </p>
            <p>
                According to the 18th-century philosopher Immanuel Kant, the task of philosophy is united by four questions: (1) What can I know?; (2) What should I do?; (3) What may I hope?; and (4)
                What is the human being? His entire career, as he conceived it, was devoted to systematically addressing these four questions.
